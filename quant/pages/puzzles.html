          If you refuse. you lose the game, along with the original ten dollars. 
          What is the minimum probability of winning the game that you would need to accept the increased bet?</h3>
        <p>Hint: To play the increased bet, gain/loss should be more than gain/loss by not playing. <a href="../puzzles/3.html">Solution</a></p>
