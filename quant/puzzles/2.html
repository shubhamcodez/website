    <h2>You have a pile of 100 coins. 1 of the coins is an unfair coin and has heads on both sides. The remaining 99 coins are fair coins. You randomly select a coin from the pile and flip it 10 times. The coin lands heads all 
            10 times. Calculate the probability that the coin you selected is the unfair coin.</h2>
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
        This is a Bayes' theorem question. The formula for Bayes' theorem is: <br>
        P(A|B) = P(B|A) x P(A) / P(B) <br><br>
        
        In this case: <br>
        A = Unfair coin <br>
        B = Getting heads 10 times in a row <br>
        <br>
        Hence, 
        P(Unfair coin | 10 heads in a row) = P(10 heads in a row | Unfair coin) x P(Unfair coin) / P(10 heads in a row) <br>
        <br>
        We have the following values,  <br>
        P(10 heads in a row | Unfair coin) = 1 (Because both sides of the unfair coin are heads) <br>
        P(Unfair coin) = 1/100 <br>
        P(10 heads in a row) = 1/100*1 + 99/100*1/2^10 <br>
        <br>
        P(unfair coin | 10 heads in a row) = P(10 heads in a row | Unfair coin) x P(Unfair coin) + P(10 heads in a row | Fair coin) x P(Fair coin) <br>
        = 1*1/100 / (1 x 1/100 + 1/2^10 x 99/100) <br>
        â‰ˆ 0.9118 (or approximately 91.18%) <br>
        <br>
        Therefore, the probability of the coin being unfair given that it landed heads 10 times in a row is approximately 91.18%. <br>
