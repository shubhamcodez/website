    <h2>You have a pile of 100 coins. 1 of the coins is an unfair coin and has heads on both sides. The remaining 99 coins are fair coins. You randomly select a coin from the pile and flip it 10 times. The coin lands heads all 
            10 times. Calculate the probability that the coin you selected is the unfair coin.</h2>
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    This is a Bayes' theorem question. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:
    $$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}$$
    In this case:
    A = Unfair coin
    B = Getting heads 10 times in a row
    Hence,
    $$P(\text{Unfair coin} | 10 \text{ heads in a row}) = \frac{P(10 \text{ heads in a row} | \text{Unfair coin}) \times P(\text{Unfair coin})}{P(10 \text{ heads in a row})}$$
    We have the following values:
    $$P(10 \text{ heads in a row} | \text{Unfair coin}) = 1 \quad (\text{Because both sides of the unfair coin are heads})$$
    $$P(\text{Unfair coin}) = \frac{1}{100}$$
    $$P(10 \text{ heads in a row}) = \frac{1}{100} \times 1 + \frac{99}{100} \times \frac{1}{2^{10}}$$
    $$P(\text{unfair coin} | 10 \text{ heads in a row}) = \frac{P(10 \text{ heads in a row} | \text{Unfair coin}) \times P(\text{Unfair coin})}{P(10 \text{ heads in a row} | \text{Unfair coin}) \times P(\text{Unfair coin}) + P(10 \text{ heads in a row} | \text{Fair coin}) \times P(\text{Fair coin})}$$
    $$= \frac{1 \times \frac{1}{100}}{1 \times \frac{1}{100} + \frac{1}{2^{10}} \times \frac{99}{100}} \approx 0.9118 \quad (\text{or approximately } 91.18\%)$$
    Therefore, the probability of the coin being unfair given that it landed heads 10 times in a row is approximately 91.18%.
