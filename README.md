## Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my React based personal site.
The site is automatically deployed to **GitHub Pages** using the workflow in
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. The workflow builds the React app and pushes the
contents of the `build/` directory to the `gh-pages` branch.

### Accessing the site

<https://shubhamcodez.github.io/website/>

### GitHub Pages configuration

Make sure the repository settings use the `gh-pages` branch as the publishing
source. If the site renders plain text, check that the workflow ran and that the
`gh-pages` branch is selected in the Pages settings.
