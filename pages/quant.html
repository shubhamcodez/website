      <h2>What is Quantitative Finance?</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Quantitative Finance, often referred to as "Quant Finance," involves the use of mathematical models, computational techniques, and statistical methods to analyze financial markets and securities. 
        Quantitative Analysts, or "Quants," work in investment banks, hedge funds, asset management firms, and proprietary trading firms. The field encompasses topics like risk management, algorithmic trading, derivatives pricing, portfolio optimization, and high-frequency trading.
